# Maze_Solver
---
## Description

- A Terminal Based App to find the path from S point to E point in 2D Matrix
- 2D matrix should have starting point at (0,0) and Ending point (n,n)
- It has walls(obstacles)ðŸ§± between 1-25% of the matrix cells
- Asking user whether to generate maze or to print path from S to E if possible
- You have to find all the possible path

## Approach

- You can use the **BFS(Breadth First Search)** technique to achieve the goal
- In BFS we check all the possible direction i.e top, right, bottom, left and similarly it goes on till its possible.
- I have used **Set and Queue data structure** to keep the track of visited cells and queue to traverse in bfs manner as it follows **FIFO principle**

**Refer below visiual representation**
